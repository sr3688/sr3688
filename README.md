## Who am I :question:
Well ! I am an undergraduate student at Delhi University (School of Open Learning) persuing **Bachelor of Arts**. Although it wasn't my plan, just like a Science Stream student i also wanted to get into a well reputed engineering college but sometimes things don't turn out the way you want. It turns out that I would have to be a Self-taught Developer. Currently I am persuing a Deploma in Software Engineering (Web Development). Teaching oneself how to code can be chellenging but i guess this is the only path which cah take me where I want to be. So, with all the positivity I have started my journey and I hope a technical degree dose't matter as much as i thought it does.

## Education
- Intermediate Schooling with PCM
- Graduation in Bechalor of Arts (Will graduate in 2021)
