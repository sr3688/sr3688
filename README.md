 <h2 align='center'>About MeðŸ¤“</h2>
<p align='center'>I am a programming enthusiast unlikely from non-tech background,I know that makes a huge difference and the opportunitis would not welcome me as compared to those who have a technical degree.But i'm here to fight and I am surely going to win. According to me anyone can do anything and everyone has every talent, this is just a matter of effort which makes the difference. No one is bright and no one is dull its just that how much we brush ourselves. So, i'm here in the race with this positivity. Focused on learning the unlearned. And yes, I WILL DO IT.</p>
